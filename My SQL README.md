SQL Exercises Portfolio

Welcome to my SQL Exercises repository! This project demonstrates my proficiency in SQL across various concepts, including querying, joins, aggregate functions,
date/time functions, conditional logic, and data cleaning. The exercises are based on multiple sample datasets covering employees, students, sales, products, and more.

Basic Queries

SELECT: Retrieve all columns or specific columns from a table.
SELECT DISTINCT: Find unique values in a column.
ORDER BY: Sort results by one or more columns.
LIMIT: Display a specific number of rows.

Example:
-- Retrieve all employees
SELECT * FROM employees;

-- List unique departments
SELECT DISTINCT department FROM employees;

-- Top 5 highest-paid employees
SELECT first_name, last_name, salary
FROM employees
ORDER BY salary DESC
LIMIT 5;

Aggregate Functions

COUNT, SUM, AVG, MIN, MAX to analyze datasets.
GROUP BY for aggregation per category.
HAVING to filter aggregated results.

Example:
-- Average age per department
SELECT department, AVG(age) AS avg_age
FROM students
GROUP BY department;

-- Count students per department with more than 1 student
SELECT department, COUNT(*) AS student_count
FROM students
GROUP BY department
HAVING COUNT(*) > 1;

Filtering and Conditions

WHERE for row-level filtering.
AND, OR, NOT, IN, BETWEEN to combine conditions.
CASE statements for conditional classification.

Example:
-- Students aged between 21 and 23
SELECT student_id, name, age
FROM students
WHERE age BETWEEN 21 AND 23;

-- Classify products by price
SELECT product_name, price,
CASE
  WHEN price > 1000 THEN 'Expensive'
  WHEN price BETWEEN 100 AND 1000 THEN 'Mid-range'
  ELSE 'Budget'
END AS price_category
FROM products;

JOIN Operations

INNER JOIN: Match rows present in both tables.
LEFT JOIN: Include all rows from the left table, even if no match exists.
FULL OUTER JOIN: Include all rows from both tables.

Example:
-- Students with grades
SELECT A.student_id, student_name, grade
FROM students AS A
INNER JOIN grades AS B
ON A.student_id = B.student_id;

-- Total sales per region, including regions with no sales
SELECT A.region_id, region_name, SUM(amount) AS total_sales
FROM regions AS A
LEFT JOIN sales AS B
ON A.region_id = B.region_id
GROUP BY A.region_id, region_name;

Date and Time Functions

DATEADD: Add or subtract time intervals.
DATEDIFF: Calculate the difference between dates.
TO_CHAR / DATEFROMPARTS: Format or construct dates.
CURRENT_DATE / CURRENT_TIMESTAMP: Work with todayâ€™s date/time.

Example:
-- Add 6 months to the hire date
SELECT emp_id, name, hire_date,
DATEADD(MONTH, 6, hire_date) AS hire_plus_6_months
FROM Employees;

-- Calculate days remaining until events
SELECT event_id, event_name,
DATEDIFF(DAY, CURRENT_DATE, event_date) AS days_remaining
FROM Events;

Handling NULL Values

IFNULL / ISNULL / COALESCE to handle missing data.
Replace NULLs with default values for reporting.

Example:
-- Display salary as 0 if NULL
SELECT employee_id, name,
IFNULL(salary, 0) AS salary_with_default
FROM Employees;

-- Show email or 'No Email'
SELECT customer_id, name,
COALESCE(email, 'No Email') AS email_display
FROM Customers;

Combining Tables with UNION

UNION: Combine results and remove duplicates.
UNION ALL: Combine results, keeping duplicates.

Example:
-- Unique customer names from online and store sales
SELECT customer_name FROM online_sales
UNION
SELECT customer_name FROM store_sales;

-- Total combined sales per customer
SELECT customer_name, SUM(amount) AS total_spent
FROM (
  SELECT customer_name, amount FROM online_sales
  UNION ALL
  SELECT customer_name, amount FROM store_sales
) AS combined_sales
GROUP BY customer_name
ORDER BY total_spent DESC;
